## Time Log application
 
This application can be used to keep a track record of your learning. You can create a session, then end that session, at last, you can keep the records of the topics you've covered throughout the session. Like this, anyone can create multiple sessions.

At first, you will find the table color and box is red but after completing 3 hours of the total session, the color will be green.
